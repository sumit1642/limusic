	// Theater mode: the window goes fullscreen and the app is replaced by one thing — the cover and

	// the flag the only switch: nothing else has to remember to undo the window state.
	//
	// PERFORMANCE, read before adding anything pretty. WebKitGTK re-runs a filter for the *damaged*
	// region on every repaint, and the region here holds lyrics that repaint every frame (the
	// karaoke sweep). Everything below has already been measured against that once, so the bans are
	// the design, not a preference:
	//   - no `filter` / `backdrop-filter` on anything full-screen (the cover wash is baked into a
	//     48px canvas once per track instead — see `wash` — and upscaled, which is free);
	//   - no `mask-image` on the lyrics scroller (buffers the whole thing offscreen per frame);
	//   - no large-radius `box-shadow` over the backdrop (re-blurred on every repaint under it);
	//   - nothing full-screen animates. A moving viewport-sized layer damages the whole viewport
	//     every frame and drags every other repaint with it.
	// Depth comes from radial gradients, which are painted fills and cost nothing.

		     Never give this a `mask-image` for the end fades, however tempting: it buffers the whole
		     scroller offscreen on every scroll frame. Same for `backdrop-filter` (see the header).
		     The scrollbar is hidden from out here, since the child owns the scroller. === -->
