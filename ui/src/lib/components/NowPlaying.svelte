<!-- Covers the page but not the sidebar (you navigate away to minimise) and not the player bar,

     z-20 matches the highest a page uses for its own chrome (home's sticky mood chips) and wins the
     tie on DOM order, since <main> is static and its z-indexes land in the same stacking context.
     The player bar and the queue/lyrics panels come later/higher, so they still paint above.

	<!-- The artwork itself, blurred to a wash, is the background: same trick as HomeHero, and it
	     needs no colour extraction (which a remote image would taint the canvas for anyway). The
	     120px variant is the one the player bar has already loaded for this track, so this costs
	     no request and nothing new to decode.
	     Two opacities because the wash sits on opposite grounds: over white it has to stay pale
	     enough for dark text, over near-black it can carry more colour before muted-foreground
	     stops reading. Turn them up together if it's too subtle.

	     Not while a video is playing. WebKitGTK re-runs this 40px blur for the damaged region on
	     every video frame, and the damaged region is the video, so the cost grows with the window.
	     Measured 2026-08-20 on a 1100px box, 720p30: with the wash 13 fps of video and 74ms UI
	     frames, without it 30 fps and 17ms. Layer promotion does not help (will-change,
	     translateZ(0) and contain:paint all measured as noise), and the cost tracks the blur
	     radius rather than the image. A video fills the view on its own, so there is nothing to
	     replace it with. -->

	     padding have had theirs, at 75% so the square doesn't dominate the view.
	     ponytail: 11rem is those three measured, not computed. The 0.75 leaves it plenty of slack
	     now, so only a much taller player bar would need it raised.

	     A video gets its own budget, and a wider cap to spend it in. 16:9 in the square's width
	     leaves half the height empty, so --vid is the width that spends the same leftover height
	     instead: height * 16 / 9, capped by the column (max-width can only shrink `w-full`). The
