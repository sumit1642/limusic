 * order, split wherever the tracks change origin: a manual block ("Play next" / "Add to queue",
 * headed by what it was added from), the playing context ("Next from: …"), autoplay's continuation.
 *
 * What sits in front of the playing track is two different things, and `playedFrom` is the border
 * (`state.rs`). `prev` is the history: what was actually heard or skipped past, oldest first, so the
 * last thing heard sits directly above the playing track. `earlier` is the rest of the queue in
 * front of it, which playback never reached: start an album at track 4 and the backend still queues
 * tracks 1-3, untouched. The panel draws `earlier` and hides `prev` behind a toggle, because the
 * prefix is bounded by the playlist and shrinks every time you press previous, while history is
 * unbounded and grows all session.
 *
 * Play order, not kind order: grouping by kind would draw an "Add to queue" block that sits at the
 * tail under the playing playlist's heading, naming a playlist those tracks never came from.
 *
 * Shuffle collapses that split. The backend deliberately interleaves everything it shuffles, so
 * origins alternate track by track and a per-origin split degenerates into one heading per row —
 * the shuffled run becomes a single block instead. What shuffle leaves alone keeps its own: the
 * pinned "Play next" block ahead of it, autoplay's filler behind it. Turning shuffle off restores
 * the real order, and with it the blocks.
