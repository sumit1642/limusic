//! Custom app icon (#173): the icon the user picked, pushed at every surface that can take one
//! while the app is running.
//!
//! Three of the four Windows icon surfaces are reachable from here. The fourth is not: the icon
//! Explorer, the Start menu and a pinned shortcut show comes from a resource compiled into the
//! .exe, and a running process cannot rewrite its own mapped binary (an update would replace it
//! anyway). That one stays whatever was bundled.
//!
//! There is no settings row behind this. The file's existence *is* the setting, which is also why
//! the picked image is copied here rather than referenced in place: deleting or moving the
//! original would otherwise leave the app iconless at the next launch.
